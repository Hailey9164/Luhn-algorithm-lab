Credit Card Generator, Corruptor, and Luhn Validator

## Overview
This program generates thousands of simulated credit card numbers, applies the Luhn checksum algorithm, intentionally corrupts the numbers through digit flips and transpositions, and then tests whether the corrupted numbers still pass Luhn validation. The goal is to explore the robustness of the Luhn algorithm and observe how often random corruption results in a valid or invalid card number.
The program demonstrates:

- Randomized credit card number generation

- Card‑type–specific prefix rules

- Implementation of the Luhn checksum algorithm
  
- Digit manipulation (flipping and transposing)
  
- Validation testing
  
- Use of enums, character arrays, and helper functions
